###What?
######*"All your favorite celebrities. All their information. All on just one page."* - Celebsmash.

Celebsmash is a program which combines multiple different social media sites onto one page for a specific celebrity. The purpose being to allow the user to see all of their chosen celebrities information without having to go to multiple different websites. Currently there is a selection of ten celebrities and their information is hard-coded into hash that is called when the user either submits the name or clicks on the picture of the celebrity they would like to veiw. If I get a chance to go back and work on this project more I would like to include the use of APIs.

###Why?
This was my final project which I created in just a few days during a two week Intro to Programming course at the Flatiron School in NYC. It was made with Sinatra using ruby, html and css all of which I had limited knowledge prior to the course. This project was my first time combining front and back end development. The purpose of this project was mainly to learn how to use the Sinatra platform and demonstrate our ability build something using ruby and html/css.

###Challenges
1. Creating only one html result page that would be fed the chosen celebrities information at run time. This way I did not have to creat ten seperate html pages for each celebrity and the addition of API's and web seaching addons would be made much simpler
2. learning how to connect front and back end code
3. creating an image form that would sumbit the celeb's name to the application controller. This was solves by creating a method in ruby to manipulate the the paramater sent by the form so that they could be properly read and searched in the hash of celebrity information
